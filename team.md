# About us

We are a team of entrepreneurs from MIT and Stanford. We studied engineering as undergraduates, and worked in the world of banking, tech, and consulting in New York, Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, Hong Kong, London before building startups in Silicon Valley. We are now based in Asia. We create, build, and implement experiments quickly for profitable ideas.


## Values

Our 5 values are:

1. **Results**
1. **Iteration**
1. **Transparency**
1. **Collaboration**
1. **Efficiency**

Our values govern how we behave. They describe our expectations from people we hire. They help guide us on how to behave in the organization and what to expect from others. Values are a framework for distributed decision making; they allow you to determine what to do without asking your manager. 

* It is most important to focus on **Results**
* We trust **fast Iteration** and **radical Transperancy** will lead to Results. 
* Our emphasis on **Collaboration** and **Efficiency** distinguishes us from other companies.
